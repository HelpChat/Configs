# Crate area configuration:
# 
# Almost all entries in areas are optional
# although you must have a drop_counter and drop_chance entry.
# You must also have a rewards section with at least 1 valid reward list for the area to be loaded.
# 
# areas:
#   (region, mine, or world name): 
#     permission: (if you want players to have a certain permission to obtain crates in this area, add the permission node here)
#     drop_counter: (how many blocks need to be broken before a crate has a chance to spawn)
#     drop_chance: (what is the chance out of 100.0 that a crate will spawn when the counter reaches 0)
#     alternate_areas:
#     - (if you would like to allow this area options to be used for other areas)
#     - (that way all rewards and options are shared, you can list the alternate area names here)
#     - world_nether
#     - world_the_end
#     counted_materials:
#     - (if you only want to have certain materials count towards the counter)

#         permission: (optional if you require players have certain permission to obtain rewards in this list)
#         max_rewards_per_crate: (max amount of rewards a player can get in a crate from this list)
#         only_owner_can_open: (should only the person this crate spawned for be allowed to open it)
#         crate_spawn_actions: (these actions are performed when a crate holding this reward list is spawned)

# ==================================================
# 
# CRATE SPAWN CHANCE INFORMATION
# 
# This chance can be any double value from 0.01 to 100.0
# it is percentage based, so if you set the chance to 10.0
# there will be a 10% chance a crate will spawn when the break
# counter reaches 0. If you set it to 99.0, there will be a 99% chance
# that a crate will spawn when the counter rewaches 0.
# 
# ==================================================
# 
# REWARD CHANCE INFORMATION
# 
# All rewards in a specific reward list have a chance associated with the item/commands that are executed for that reward.
# All reward chances in a list must add up to or be less than 100.0
# Example:
# 
#     rewards:
#       VIP_REWARDS:
#         priority: 1
#         permission: vip.rewards
#         max_rewards_per_crate: 1
#         only_owner_can_open: true
#         items:
#           item_1:
#             chance: 10.0
#             item:
#               material: DIAMOND
#               amount: 128
#           item_2:
#             chance: 15.0
#             item:
#               material: IRON_INGOT
#               amount: 64
#           item_3:
#             chance: 25.0
#             item:
#               material: DIRT
#               amount: 64
#           command_1:
#             chance: 25.0
#             commands:
#             - [command] eco give @p 25
#             - [msg] You got 25 bucks
# 
# With this example, all of our chances add up to 75.0,
# This means that there is a 25% chance that we get nothing each time a reward is
# being selected. If we want to make sure players always get a reward, we could
# simply add one more reward item or command with the remainder percentage for all of our
# chances to equal 100.0, which would be 25.0.
# This system allows you to set what items are rare, and which items are going to be
# more commonly selected when the plugin chooses rewards.
# Always keep in mind that all reward chances must be less than, or add up to 100.0
# If your combined chance exceeds 100.0, the rewards that are being checked after 100.0 has
# been reached will not be loaded. Also remember, to make it where a player has a chance to get
# no reward, always leave the total chance less than 100.0 as all chance remaining will
# be the chance amount that no reward is chosen.
# 
# ==================================================
# 
# CRATE SPAWN/DESPAWN/OPEN/COMMANDS ACTION IDENTIFIERS
# 
# Any action added to these lists must contain a specific identifier
# as there are more actions than just commands to be executed.
# These actions are as follows:
# 
# [msg] <message>
# This will send a raw message to the target player
# 
# [broadcast] <message>
# This will broadcast a message to the entire server
# 
# [command] <command here>
# This will execute a command in the console
# 
# [worldsound] <sound> <volume> <pitch>
# This will play a sound to the entire world at the crate location
# 
# [playersound] <sound> <volume> <pitch>
# This will play a sound to the target player
# 
# [effect] <effectName>
# This will play a preset effect at the crate location
# 
# effect names:
#   animatedball
#   arc
#   atom

#   circle
#   cloud
#   cone
#   cube

# 
# Optional: display a temporary hologram above the MineCrate when it is spawned.
# 
# To enable this feature, add the following entry to the top of your config file:
# 
# You can either use HolographicDisplays API to display the hologram, or the internal
# hologram mechanics. Set handler: none to disable holograms
# 
# Note: the internal hologram handler is only available for 1.8.8
# More hologram handlers will be coming soon.

# Inside of the message, you can use the following placeholders:
#  %player% - shows players name who MineCrate is for
#  %area% - name of the area the crate spawned in
#  %rewardlist% - name of the list the rewards were chosen from
#  %rewards% - amount of rewards inside of the MineCrate
