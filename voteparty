# The hook part of the config allows you to configure which plugins you would like to hook into for votes.
# By default, the plugin will utilize NuVotifier and listen for it's vote events.
# If you would like to use the plugin without NuVotifier, just disable the hook!
# NOTE: Keep in mind that without being hooked into a vote plugin, the plugin will not automatically handle votes.
# You will be required to do everything manually.
# Over time, more plugins may become supported!
